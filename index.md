Ongoing SCADA Recon – Exposing ICS Systems in the Wild

# Industrial Control Systems: Port 4443 Recon (Ongoing)

_OpenIntelHunter is a continuously evolving passive reconnaissance project focused on ICS/SCADA systems exposed on the public internet._

This project documents real-world control systems with publicly accessible interfaces, misconfigurations, and outdated industrial technologies — observed through passive OSINT techniques.

---
## Current Highlights

- Monitoring port **4443** for exposed interfaces in industrial environments
- Identifying targets with **self-signed TLS certs**, legacy web panels, and unsecured remote access
- Common vendor fingerprints: `Schneider-Electric`, `zenon`, `Indusoft`, and more
- Evidence includes full request headers, screenshots, and metadata

## Evidence Repository

All findings, artifacts, and fingerprints are updated frequently:

## Why This Matters

ICS/SCADA systems often claim to be air-gapped — yet time and again, OSINT reveals otherwise. This project exists to raise awareness, aid responsible disclosures, and push vendors toward real security.

### Stay Tuned

More ports, more fingerprints, more real-world exposures.
