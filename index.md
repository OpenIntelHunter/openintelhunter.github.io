# 🔍 Industrial Control Systems: Port 4443 OSINT Recon

In July 2025, I conducted a passive reconnaissance effort focused on ICS/SCADA systems with exposed management interfaces.

## Key Findings

- Publicly accessible devices exposing **port 4443** (commonly used for HTTPS).
- Multiple instances identified with **expired/self-signed certificates**.
- Some servers exposed `Schneider-Electric` headers and legacy HMI portals.
- Weak security practices — outdated software, default login pages, and no geo/IP restrictions.
- Targets ranged from **building automation** to **industrial control panels**.

## Evidence Repository

## Why It Matters

SCADA systems are critical, yet often exposed due to misconfigurations or poor vendor defaults. This effort reinforces the need for passive recon and responsible disclosure.
