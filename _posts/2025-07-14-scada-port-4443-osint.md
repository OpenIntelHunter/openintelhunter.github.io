title: "Exposed by Default: SCADA Devices and Port 4443"

While exploring ICS/SCADA infrastructure with OSINT tools like Shodan and Censys, I discovered multiple exposed industrial devices—some obsolete and unsupported—still publicly accessible via port 4443.

These are **real systems**, not honeypots. Their exposure reveals a severe gap between assumed isolation and actual implementation. If I can see them, so can threat actors.

I’ll share specific examples, explain why port 4443 matters, and propose what needs to be done to secure these systems before something worse happens.

> Full write-up: coming soon.

Stay tuned, and follow me on GitHub for detailed disclosures and passive recon techniques.
