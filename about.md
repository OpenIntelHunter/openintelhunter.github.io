## About Me

I'm **Walter**, an aspiring cybersecurity analyst and the mind behind **OpenIntelHunter**.

With over 15 years of experience in IT support — managing Windows, macOS, M365, Active Directory, and remote environments — I've developed a deep technical foundation. But my growing passion lies in **OSINT (Open Source Intelligence)** and **SCADA/ICS cybersecurity**.

I created this site to document what I discover through passive reconnaissance: exposed systems, outdated industrial control panels, and systemic vulnerabilities that are hiding in plain sight.

This isn’t about hacking — it’s about **visibility**, **awareness**, and promoting **responsible disclosure** before bad actors exploit what should have been fixed long ago.

## Let’s Connect

If your organization runs SCADA/ICS infrastructure and wants to understand what’s already exposed — I can help. I use public tools and pattern analysis to see what others might miss.
